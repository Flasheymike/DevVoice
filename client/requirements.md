## Packages
framer-motion | sophisticated animations for voice interface and state transitions
regenerator-runtime | required for some speech recognition polyfills if needed (using native API primarily)

## Notes
Voice interface uses Web Speech API (window.SpeechRecognition and window.speechSynthesis)
Dark mode is default for terminal/hacker aesthetic
